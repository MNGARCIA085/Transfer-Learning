### Transfer Learning
Welcome! This repository is dedicated to exploring transfer learning techniques in the field of machine learning, designed to foster learning and experimentation in this powerful paradigm.

### Goals
The primary goal of this repository is to delve into transfer learning methods and their applications across various machine learning tasks. Transfer learning leverages knowledge gained from solving one problem to improve performance on a related, but different, problem. By understanding and applying transfer learning techniques, practitioners can expedite model training, improve generalization, and achieve better performance, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data.
